# GrobTree – Structured Log Intelligence for IntelliJ IDEA

**Explore complex logs without leaving your IDE.** GrobTree clusters raw streams into interactive trees so you can spot request/response pairs, runtime metrics, and payload anomalies in seconds.

## Why GrobTree
- **Shorten log spelunking** – Replace scrolling text panes with a drill-down tree that keeps structure, colours, and icons aligned with your domain.
- **Stay in IntelliJ IDEA** – Attach GrobTree directly to run/debug configurations or tail external files; no extra viewers required.
- **Bring your own semantics** – Customise parsing, captions, icons, and KPIs through `ConverterConfig.xml` and extension APIs.
- **Share live insight** – Export processed trees, capture statistics, and bake presets so every teammate sees the same, reliable view.

---

## Feature Highlights
- **One Log, Many Views** – Split raw logs into individual outputs using regex boundaries or single-line mode. Each output becomes a node with fully customisable captions, colours, icons, and metadata.
- **Live Streaming & Attachments** – Consume logs on-the-fly from IntelliJ run configurations, external processes, and file tails. GrobTree manages one tab per stream and keeps stripes/icons in sync with running state.
- **Rich Tree Navigation** – Expand/collapse top-level entries, inspect nested payloads, open correlated nodes, and jump straight into a common text editor to see the original snippet.
- **Search & Correlation** – Use the integrated find toolbar to highlight matching nodes. Corresponding-node comparers detect request/response pairs so you can traverse related log entries without scanning by hand.
- **Statistics & Metrics** – Capture runtime stats (durations, message counts, custom KPIs) from your top-node creators and visualise them in context.
- **Tailored for CXF & Beyond** – Ships with converters for popular stacks—including Apache CXF advanced logging—and can be tuned for any log style using the external configuration format.

## Try GrobTree in Minutes
1. **Install the plugin** – Grab the latest ZIP from the [release page](https://github.com/bgronostay/grobtree/releases/latest) and install it via *Settings → Plugins → ⚙ → Install Plugin from Disk…* (IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3+).
2. **Load a configuration** – Stick with the bundled preset or point GrobTree at your own `ConverterConfig.xml`/JAR.
3. **Open a playground log** – Use one of the sample files under [`examples/logs/`](./examples/logs) such as:
   - `cxf-example.log` – verbose SOAP/REST exchanges generated by the CXF demo.
   - `spring-rest-example.log` – a RESTful order service with JSON payloads, statistics, and error paths.
4. **Explore the tree** – Watch nodes group by request, inspect payloads inline, and jump between correlated entries.

Prefer live data? Attach GrobTree to a running configuration and let it stream new lines directly into the tree.

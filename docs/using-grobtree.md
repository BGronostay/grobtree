# Using GrobTree

## User Interface
When the plugin loads for the first time the GrobTree tool window appears in a deliberately minimal state. IntelliJ prevents plugins from performing heavy initialisation before the user explicitly interacts with the UI, so GrobTree only renders a lightweight panel with two primary actions:

- **Open tabs for running configurations** – scans active run/debug processes and opens dedicated GrobTree tabs that immediately begin evaluating live output.
- **Open new tab** – creates an empty tab so you can import logs from disk, clipboard, or a file tail.

Once a tab is created the full toolbar, tree, search controls, and statistics features become available. This lazy-loading approach keeps IDE startup responsive while still giving you quick access to the complete GrobTree experience as soon as you need it.

The main action bar surfaces import, attach, search, and save controls as soon as a tab is active:

## Exploring the Log Tree
- **Main Toolbar** – manage tabs, attach/detach streams, save buffers, switch output representations (tree, JSON, XML, plain text).
- **Find Toolbar** – search across captions/content, iterate matches, toggle case sensitivity.
- **Context Menu** – open nodes in editors, copy structured payloads, invoke custom actions contributed by extensions.
- **Statistics Dialog** – display aggregated metrics per converter, optionally exported.

Selecting a node synchronises the common editor view, highlights search hits, and reveals corresponding nodes with bold styling and icons.

## Configuring GrobTree

### IntelliJ Settings
Open `Settings → Tools → GrobTree` to choose how the plugin sources its configuration. You can stay on the bundled defaults for a quick tour, point to an external `ConverterConfig.xml`, or load a JAR so GrobTree can resolve custom factories, icons, and resources. Toggling “Override tool window title/icon” applies branding metadata from the selected configuration, and the Advanced settings page exposes log-tail defaults, buffer sizes, and other power-user tweaks.

### ConverterConfig.xml
The `ConverterConfig.xml` file controls every stage of parsing and presentation. Its root element carries metadata (`name`, `version`, branding attributes) and enforces the schema version GrobTree expects (`config-version="1.2.0"`, optional `api-version`) so the plugin can refuse incompatible files before loading them.

- **Metadata & Branding** – attributes like `pluginName` and `pluginIconPath` let the configuration restyle the tool window when the user enables overrides in settings.
- **LogProviders** – define named ingestion pipelines and the `LogProviderListener` class (optionally via a factory) that converts raw text into structured messages.
- **Transformations** – configure search/replace steps that run before parsing, including enablement flags and toolbar icons for each transformation.
- **Factory** – registers the fully qualified factory class GrobTree calls when it needs to instantiate processing listeners or node creators exposed by extensions. Not needed if you use fqClassName when a class is to be specified.
- **RegExs** – declare patterns that split the log stream, capture named groups, and optionally derive timestamps from matches; patterns can be stored inline or Base64-encoded and support auto-creating params for named groups.
- **RunConfigs** – map IntelliJ run configurations to evaluation presets by referencing a `configId` and, if needed, a specific regex to apply while the process runs.
- **EvaluationConfigs** – bundle everything the tree renderer needs: selectable presets, a shared `CommonConfig`, parameter extraction rules, display styling, and processing listeners.
- **Parameters** – toggle global viewer behaviours such as whether GrobTree should auto-expand preferred nodes, de-duplicate lines, or restyle captions.
- **Variables** – define reusable key/value pairs that can be interpolated across the configuration, handy for reuse between listeners or regex definitions.
- **Icons** – map symbolic icon names to resource paths inside the configuration JAR so GrobTree can resolve custom artwork at runtime.

Within an `EvaluationConfig`, `ParamConfigs` expose captured fields in captions (with specialised handling for timestamps), `ParamDisplayConfigs` colourise or iconise key values, and `ProcessingListeners` wire in either GrobTree-provided or extension-provided tree builders. External listeners or factories referenced here inherit the `ClassCreationDefinition` contract, meaning they can be singletons, constructed via a factory, or parameterised dynamically.

The bundled `ConverterConfig.xml` inside the plugin is a helpful template, and the example extension ships a pared-down version that demonstrates custom log providers and listeners working together. Start from those files, layer in your own providers and regexes, and package everything into a JAR when you are ready to distribute it.
